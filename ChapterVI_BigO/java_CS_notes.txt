primitive type "int" represents integers using 32 bits.
all variables of type int use 32 bits.

there are 8 primitive data types in Java (byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean).

an object is a large chunk of memory that can contain data and methods to process the data.

Main memory
- where programs and data are kept when processor is actively using them
- faster than secondary memory, interacts with processor constantly
- sometimes called RAM (random access memory) -- random meaning that the memory cells can be accessed in any order
- 1 MB of memory is enough to hold ~1 million characters of a word doc
- nothing permanent is kept in main memory, data is only placed in main mem for as long as needed
- if you are actively writing a word doc, the running program is located in MAIN MEM. A permanent copy will also be in secondary memory on the hard disk. the characters you type are in MAIN MEM also. when you save the doc, the characters are copied toa  file on the hard disk.

Secondary Memory
- where programs and data are kept long-term, hard disk
- data and programs here are organized into files (file = collection of data on the disk that has a name)
- not connected directly to processor
- larger capacity, generally ~ 500 GB (room for billions of word characters) ~100x main mem capacity
- slower -- the reason for having two types of storage is the difference in speed & capacity


Network
- acts as both input and output, data flows to and from computer and network
- Q: Is data transfer from the network slower or faster than from main memory? --> SLOWER!!

I/O
- input/output devices
- directly connected to an electronic module called a device controller which is connected to motherboard
- to a programmer, anything outside of processor and main mem is an I/O device

Embedded System
- a computer system that is part of a larger machine and which controls how that machine operates
- processor constantly runs a single control program which is permanently kept in read only memory (ROM)
- ROM makes a section of main memory read-only

operating system
- always present when computer is running
- connects computer hardware (keys) with software (programs)
- the operating system is responsible for starting applications, running them and managing the resources they need
- when the computer is not running, the OS is stored in the hard disk
